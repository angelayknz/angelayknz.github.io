        <h3>Long term goals</h3>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to be location independent. Since I love travel
          so much, I'd like to be a digital nomad doing things I love and
          passionate about around the globe. Another long term goal is to live
          in a tiny house within a community off-grid to grow our own food and
          live a sustainable lifestyle.
        </p>

        <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>

        <p>
          My strength is my passion for learning. I am forever curious and
          interested in a wide variety of subjects. I always feel there are so
          much to learn with so little time on hand. On the flip side however, I
          may not dive deep within each of these subjects. Another one of my
          limitations is that I don't like to ask for help. I tend to solve my
          own problems via Google or Youtube as I'd like to be self-sufficient.
          But I realize it's important to ask others for help at times, not only
          to be effective and efficient, but also to build deep and meaningful
          relationships within a community.
        </p>

        <h3>Human Skills</h3>

        <p>
          The non-tech skill I would like to develop at Dev Academy is to be
          able to communicate effectively in a virtual environment. I prefer
          face-to-face communications over online whenever possible. But the
          world we live in today has changed drastically comparing to just a
          couple of years ago. Many of the activities have been moved online. I
          am sure this will be a 'new norm' for us. Therefore, I'd like to get
          better at communicating in the cyberspace.
        </p>

        <h3>Commitment</h3>

        <p>
          I have been mentally preparing myself for this course for some time
          and have told family and friends that I need to be focused for the
          upcoming bootcamp. Therefore I won't be able to attend as many social
          events as I did previously. It is as much a commitment to myself as it
          is to the bootcamp. Luckily, for me, I already had some practice while
          doing another course last year. I have built a solid routine that
          works for me and keep my life organized.
        </p>

        <h3>Self-care</h3>
        <p>
          In general, I am a very relaxed person. I don't get stressed easily
          (except when I have a deadline that I can't meet). I believe that
          practicing mindfulness plays a big role in that. Meditation and
          journalling helps to center me and keep me grounded. Daily movement is
          extremely important to me. Be it going to the gym or going out for a
          long walk by the water. There is such a thing as mind-body connection
          in my humble opinion. Getting a daily dose of sunshine also makes me
          very happy. I find that a change of scenery can often provide me with
          some new perspectives. Step away from the problems I am working on and
          come back to it later, will ofter create a space for fresh insights.
