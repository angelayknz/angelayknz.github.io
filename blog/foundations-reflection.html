        <h3>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h3>
        <p>1. Self-compassion is part of self-care</p>
        <p>
          Having compassion for myself is as important as having compassion for
          others. When other people are having self-doubt, I am quick to offer
          encouragement and kind words. But when the same situation happens to
          me, my critical inner voice would not be so kind. Instead of
          cirticizing myself for my shortcomings, I should learn to be more
          understanding and compassionate towards myself.
        </p>
        <p>2. I can cultivate a growth mindset</p>
        <p>
          Skills and intelligence are something that I can develop. We all have
          unlimited potentials and it doesn't have to stop with the genetic
          makeup. There are many tools and apps that I can use to help me
          practice mindfulness and cultivate a growth mindset.
        </p>
        <p>3. Progress over perfection</p>
        <p>
          Perfectionism can be an obstacle when I try to learn new things such
          as coding. Sometimes I want to come up with a perfect solution to a
          problem before I start. But this tendency will normally cause
          paralysis analysis. So I have slowly learned to value progress over
          perfection and be proud of what I have achieved.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Values, empathy and self-awareness are important in all aspects of
          life, including learning and programming. Combined, they build
          positive culture, communities and societies. empathy helps us
          understand others better; and with self-awareness, we understand
          ourselves better.
        </p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          I am surprised how reflections have helped me understand myself on a
          deeper level. By writing down my thoughts and reflecting on them, I
          could almost see myself from a third person's perspective.
        </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Listening and Looping. It is difficult to be fully present at any
          given moment because the mind always wanders.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Core content will set the tone for the whole course. It is like to
          build a solid foundation before building the actual house. Learning
          core content will remove some of the obstacles in our way and help us
          become better learners overall. Core skills are what sets apart good
          programmers and great programmers.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I enjoyed the core learning. It makes the course more interesting and
          I learned something new along the way. I think spending 100% on
          technical learning can be detrimental rather than beneficial.
