        <h3>Learning Plan for Bootcamp</h3>
        <h4>
          What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for?
          What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you
          have a destination in mind?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I would like to use these new skills as a foundation for future
          learning. I would like to expand my skills to include other
          programming languages and frameworks. I want to use my skills to
          improve people's life in any aspect or capacity. I do not have a
          concrete idea as to what I want to do specifically. But I am very
          interested in the personal finance and financial literacy space.
        </p>

        <br /><br />
        <h4>
          Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your
          idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered any
          new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder
          you during Bootcamp?
        </h4>
        <p>
          During foundation, I found myself often spending much more time than I
          should on a mental block, where I should just reach out on Discord for
          help. I think that should change as we approach Bootcamp. I will set a
          time limit to work on each block so I don't waste precious time.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>
          While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not
          what we would like you to consider in this plan. Non-technical
          challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in
          groups, speaking in front of the group, keeping focused for nine
          weeks, etc.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think my biggest non tech challenge would be to get used to the
          Bootcamp schedule. I am a night person. So 8:30am start could be a
          challenge in the beginning.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>
          At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and
          improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some
          areas for development you would like to work on?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Public speaking, communication, pair programming, giving and receiving
          feedbacks.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>
          What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the
          same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is helpful to voice
          these expectations.
        </h4>
        <p>Communication and check-ins. Just to talk things out.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>
          Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help
          in a timely way?
        </h4>
        <p>
          When I need help, I will reach out to the group facilitator first. In
          event of absence or missed deadlines, I will communicate openly and
          honestly with the group and facilitator. I commit fully to put the
          Bootcamp first and foremost above everything else. I will dedicate 60+
          hours per week of time to the course. I will be kind to others and
          myself at all times during Bootcamp.
        </p>

        <h3>Long term goals</h3>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to be location independent. Since I love travel
          so much, I'd like to be a digital nomad doing things I love and
          passionate about around the globe. Another long term goal is to live
          in a tiny house within a community off-grid to grow our own food and
          live a sustainable lifestyle.
        </p>

        <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>

        <p>
          My strength is my passion for learning. I am forever curious and
          interested in a wide variety of subjects. I always feel there are so
          much to learn with so little time on hand. On the flip side however, I
          may not dive deep within each of these subjects. Another one of my
          limitations is that I don't like to ask for help. I tend to solve my
          own problems via Google or Youtube as I'd like to be self-sufficient.
          But I realize it's important to ask others for help at times, not only
          to be effective and efficient, but also to build deep and meaningful
          relationships within a community.
        </p>

        <h3>Human Skills</h3>

        <p>
          The non-tech skill I would like to develop at Dev Academy is to be
          able to communicate effectively in a virtual environment. I prefer
          face-to-face communications over online whenever possible. But the
          world we live in today has changed drastically comparing to just a
          couple of years ago. Many of the activities have been moved online. I
          am sure this will be a 'new norm' for us. Therefore, I'd like to get
          better at communicating in the cyberspace.
        </p>

        <h3>Commitment</h3>

        <p>
          I have been mentally preparing myself for this course for some time
          and have told family and friends that I need to be focused for the
          upcoming bootcamp. Therefore I won't be able to attend as many social
          events as I did previously. It is as much a commitment to myself as it
          is to the bootcamp. Luckily, for me, I already had some practice while
          doing another course last year. I have built a solid routine that
          works for me and keep my life organized.
        </p>

        <h3>Self-care</h3>
        <p>
          In general, I am a very relaxed person. I don't get stressed easily
          (except when I have a deadline that I can't meet). I believe that
          practicing mindfulness plays a big role in that. Meditation and
          journalling helps to center me and keep me grounded. Daily movement is
          extremely important to me. Be it going to the gym or going out for a
          long walk by the water. There is such a thing as mind-body connection
          in my humble opinion. Getting a daily dose of sunshine also makes me
          very happy. I find that a change of scenery can often provide me with
          some new perspectives. Step away from the problems I am working on and
          come back to it later, will ofter create a space for fresh insights.
