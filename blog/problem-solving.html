        <h3>The blocks</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Block 1: </strong> In sprint 3, I had a couple of blocks while
          doing the JavaScript Intro Challenge. The first block happened in
          Challenge 5 - Conditionals: the if and if...else statement. We are
          required to write two functions `isMatch` and `isAMatch`to compare two
          values. After I wrote my code, I console.logged each of them in the
          browser to check if the code is working and they both worked
          perfectly. But when I ran my code in the terminal, both functions
          failed. The error message reads: function was not defined. Well that
          didn't help. So I asked Google to show me how other people have solved
          the problem. Then I re wrote my code in a different way but the
          exactly same thing happened. At this point, I am certain it's my
          computer's fault. I decided to leave it for now.<br />
          <br />
          A couple of days later, we had a home group meeting. During the
          meeting, I asked our group facilitator John for help. We did a 1:1
          coaching call so John could have a look at my code. And guess what?!
          It was indeed my fault, not the computer's. I missed an 'A' in the
          second function's name. It was a spelling error!!! As soon as I
          changed the name of the function, the problems solved.

        <p>
          <strong>Block 2: </strong> Another block happened in Challenge 7 -
          Loops Q4 & Q5. I tried all the techniques I used previouly and more. I
          wrote pseudocode, googled, read error messages, re-wrote the code in a
          different way, tried to read through on the discord channel to see if
          others had similar problems. But nothing worked. So I reached out to
          the discord community. And sure enough, a fellow student who had the
          same problem shared what worked for them. While their solution did not
          immediately work for me, it pointed me to a different direction. I
          kept it running at the back of my mind and carried on with other
          tasks. I tried to tackle the problem again the next day, still not
          working. So I pondered on it for another day. I think it might be the
          third or the fourth day that all of a sudden it dawned on me what the
          solution was. It was so clear to me like an AHA moment. Lo and behold,
          it was the right solution to passed the test.
        </p>

        <h3>Have you tried explaining the problem to the rubber duck?</h3>
        <p>
          Apparantly, web developpers talk to rubber ducky about their problems.
          Who knew! I have not tried this technique yet so I cannot testify to
          that. But I am intrigued by what the rubber duck will do next time I
          encounter a block.

              <br /><br />
              - Pseudocode <br />
              - Trying something <br />
              - Reading error messages <br />
              - Console.logging <br />
              - Googling <br />
              - Asking your peers for help <br />
              - Asking coaches for help <br />
              - Improving your process with reflection

        <p>
          I tried all of the techniques above during the code challenges, except
          the rubber ducky method. I find googling is the most efficient way to
          solve problems. Because chances are, whatever problems we are having
          right now, other people already had them and had found solutions for
          them. Google normally solve 90 percent of my problems. Try asking the
          question in a different way will solve another 5 percent of the
          problems. As for the last 5 percent, ask for input from the real
          people that either had the similar experience or are on the same
          journey as you.
